By running `npm run build`, the production deployable project is built.

## Git Repository
The training has been split into a few checkpoints, the code base at each of these checkpoints can be found in their own branch. The branch follow a naming convention like `<checkpoint-number>_<breif-description>`. The `master` branch contains the complete latest code.
